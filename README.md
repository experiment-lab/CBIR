Context based image retrieval is retrieving images from a large database of digital images using computer system. Hence the features of individual images have been extracted through which we will study about computer based image recognition. For every image we are extracting color feature, shape feature and texture feature and use them for computation purpose. The data base contains different images and can be classified into ten different classes and each class has same type of images. This study is about to check the performance of every feature for different type of images and to see the ability of features to discriminate the images between classes.
